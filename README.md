# indexeddb-search

## Introduction

IndexedDB-Search is a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation that demonstrates full-text search capabilities on top of IndexedDB. It is designed to showcase how full-text search functionalities can be integrated with IndexedDB, running entirely on the client side to enable efficient, offline-capable search features for web applications.
